# sd-danbooru-tags-upsampler

Êó•Êú¨Ë™û„ÅØ[„Åì„Å°„Çâ](./README-ja.md)„Å∏

An extension for Stable Diffusion Web UI that upsamples prompts by generating or completing danbooru tags using lightweight LLM.

It's useful for people who don't want think about long prompt or want to see **diverse**, **natural** and **high quality** images without any thinking.

## Usage

<img src="./images/screenshot-1.jpg" width="540px" alt="Scrennshot of this extension" />

Open the `Danbooru Tags Upsampler` accordion and check the `Enable` checkbox to enable this extension.

Explanation of parameters:

| Parameter name | Description | Example value |
| -------------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| **Total tag length** | This parameter can specify the amount of **total tags after completing the positive prompt**. Not the amount of completing tags. `very short` means "less than 10 tags", `short` means "less than 20 tags", `long` means "less than 40 tags" and `very long` is more than that. | `long` is recommended |
| **Ban tags** | All tags in this field will never appear in completion tags. It's useful when you don't want to contain some specific tags. | `official alternate costume, english text, animal focus, ...` |
| **Seed for upsampling tags** | If this number and the positive prompt are fixed, the completion tags are also fixed. `-1` means "generates tags using random seed every time" | If you want to generate images with different final prompts every time, set to `-1`. |
| **Upsampling timing** | When to upsample, before or after styles are applied. | `Before applying styles` |

## Access to the model weights

This extension uses the following model:

- `p1atdev/dart-v1-sft`: [ü§ó HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/p1atdev/dart-v1-sft)

## Want to use without sd webui?

A demo on ü§ó Space is avaiable, so you can try upsampling tags without installing this extension:
